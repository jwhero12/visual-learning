# **Medical Image Analysis with SAM and Edge Detection**

## üìå **Project Purpose and Objective**

This project aims to segment fine structures (e.g., retinal vessels) in medical images by independently evaluating **Segment Anything Model (SAM)** and **Edge Detection** techniques, as well as exploring the potential combination of these two approaches. The ultimate goal is to overcome the limitations of existing methods and improve the precision and efficiency of medical image analysis.

### **Key Challenges and Solutions**
- **SAM**: Struggles with segmenting structures that have low contrast or complex patterns.  
- **Edge Detection**: Effectively detects fine structures but is sensitive to noise.  

### **Project Overview**
1. **Segment Anything Model (SAM)**  
   - Utilizes a grid-based segmentation approach.  
   - Optimizes performance by tuning parameters and applying color inversion.  

2. **TEED Model-Based Edge Detection**  
   - Applies preprocessing techniques, such as CLAHE and Gaussian Blur, to reduce noise and enhance structure detection.  
   - Experiments with post-processing methods like Median and Bilateral Filtering.  

### **Expected Contribution**
This project analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of SAM and Edge Detection independently, evaluates their performance qualitatively and quantitatively, and explores their combined potential to enhance reliability and accuracy in medical image analysis.

## üöÄ **How to Start the Project**

### **2-1. Running SAM**
To be added soon.

### **2-2. Running TEED**
Follow the instructions below, or refer to `retina_edgedetection.ipynb`.
The TEED model is not currently included in the GitHub repository. Please refer to [TEED GitHub Repository](https://github.com/xavysp/TEED.git) for further details.

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Pre-requisites**
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xavysp/TEED.git
```
Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install thop
pip install kornia
```

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Preprocessing Steps**
The preprocessing pipeline involves the following steps:
1. **Gamma Correction**  
2. **Green Channel Extraction** ‚Üí CLAHE ‚Üí Gaussian Blur ‚Üí Sharpening  
3. Repeated execution of Step 2.

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Execution**
- Place the target images in the `data` folder.  
- Run the following command:
   ```bash
   python TEED/main.py
   ```
- You can customize preprocessing and execution using `dataset.py` and `main.py`.

#### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Post-Processing**
Post-processing techniques include **Median Filtering**, **Bilateral Filtering**, and **Sharpening** to refine the results.

#### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluation**
Performance is evaluated using the following metrics:
- **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)**  
- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**  
- **NCC (Normalized Cross-Correlation)**  
- **Pixel Overlap**
